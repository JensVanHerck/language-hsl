# Hamilton Syntax Language (HSL) language support in Atom

Adds syntax highlighting and snippets to HSL files in Atom.

Given HSL's close resemblance to C syntax, this grammar was originally converted from the [C/C++ language bundle](https://github.com/atom/language-c). 
Many unnecessary grammar rules may still exist which are not relevant to HSL. These can/will be removed over time.

Contributions are greatly appreciated. Please fork this repository and open a
pull request to add snippets, make grammar tweaks, etc.
